# Christmas Shopping List

Christmas shopping list is an application that makes keeping track of christmas present buying a little bit easier. 
This repo was provided by Martha Ochoa, of October 2022 cohort.
It is being used for education purposes.

## Installation 

*Clone into your machine and cd into the file

*In your terminal run json-server --watch db.json

*Open index.html in your browser

## Usage 

*Challenge 1 - Declare a global variable, totalBudget, and assign it to a value of $300. Make this visible in the H1 at the top of the page with the text, amount left to spend.

*Challenge 2 -  In the total budget box at the bottom, write code that will allow the user to click on the div which will then show the total of gifts listed so far. The total can be displayed in the same box.

*Challenge 3 - Add functionality, that when the gift is purchased the amount left to spend at the top of the page decreases by that amount. Everything else can be left the same.

*Challenge 4 - Add new functionality that will remove the gift from the list without purchasing it. This includes adding a new button and click event that accomplishes the same removal from the page but not from the db.json. Also, because the gift was not purchased, the amount left to spend should not decrease.
